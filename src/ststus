Updating Project Status

I've just finished the core frontend features for both the Admin and Cashier interfaces, and I've also squashed those troublesome build issues. Now, I'm shifting gears to focus on streamlining the user experience and tackling some edge-case scenarios. I'm keen to make the interactions even smoother.

Confirming Build Success

I'm verifying that the frontend build is successful and addressing any blocking lint errors. I've confirmed that the front and backend are running as expected. My next focus will be on further code consolidation. I've got the core frontend pages done, state management is established, and role-based routing is working.

The project is currently in a stable, build-ready state with all core frontend features for the Admin and Cashier interfaces fully implemented.

🚀 System Status
Frontend: Running at http://localhost:5173. A production build was recently verified successfully.
Backend: Running at http://localhost:8081 (using JDK 21).
Auth: Fully functional with default credentials (admin/admin123, cashier/cashier123).
✅ Recent Accomplishments
Complete Admin Suite: Built and integrated Dashboard, Products, Inventory, User Management, Sales Reports, and System Settings.
Complete Cashier Suite: Built the Billing interface with real-time cart calculations, payment mode selection, and a searchable Invoice History.
Infrastructure: Established role-based routing, persistent global state (Zustand), and a custom Tailwind v4 design system.
Stability: Resolved critical "port in use" conflicts, JPA mapping errors, and eliminated all build-blocking lint warnings.

⏭️ Next Recommended Steps
The foundation is now solid. The next phase should focus on:

Backend Integration: Replacing the current mock data in the frontend with real API calls to the Spring Boot service.
Hardware Prep: Finalizing the barcode scanner integration for high-speed billing.
Print Engine: Implementing the receipt generation and printing logic.
